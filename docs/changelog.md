# Changelog

All notable user-facing changes to cast, newest first.

## 0.6.4

### Fixed

- **Hermes tool-call recovery** — XML `<function=…>` blocks in assistant prose (e.g. the model describing the feature itself) are no longer mis-parsed as live tool calls, preventing `400 Param Incorrect` loops on the next request. Recovery and dedup-strip now gate on actual tool names from the current session.

## 0.6.3

### Fixed

- **Streaming dedup** — Hermes models that emit both XML `<tool_call>` blocks and native function-calling in the same response no longer produce duplicate tool invocations

## 0.6.2

### Added

- `/statusbar` command — toggle, reorder, and reassign status bar segments between left/right sides via an interactive picker. Config persists across sessions. Useful on narrow/mobile terminals where the full bar overflows. Default: persona, mode, model (left) and elapsed (right); toggle others via `/statusbar`.
- `/current` command — show all status bar data in a list, including disabled segments

## 0.6.1

### Fixed

- **Terminal resync** — resize and focus-regain now use a light clear that preserves scroll position; theme changes and streaming desyncs still do a full scrollback wipe
- **lineChurn** — O(m·n) fallback for large edits uses Set-based comparison instead of raw block count; identical large texts no longer report false positive changes
- **Input parser** — DECXCPR cursor-position responses (`\x1b[row;colR`) explicitly dropped to prevent accidental keybinding matches

### Internal

- `displayWidth` extracted to `src/ui/display-width.ts` with per-session cache
- Test directories isolated to prevent parallel test collisions

## 0.6.0

### Added

- **SSH tool** — run commands on remote hosts via SSH; hosts configured in `~/.cast/ssh.json` (global) or `.cast/ssh.json` (project)
- `/queue-reset` alias — shortcut for clearing the command queue

## 0.5.8

### Added

- MCP server toggle — `/mcp` now opens an interactive multi-select picker to enable/disable individual servers mid-session. Disabled servers are hidden from the model and persisted in settings.
- `<available_mcp>` block in the system prompt — the model sees only enabled MCP servers and their tools, and will not attempt to call disabled ones.
- Hermes XML tool-call parsing and recovery
- Terminal desync tracking with automatic resync on focus return

## 0.5.7

### Added

- Enhanced search functionality with permission handling and output notes
- Improved tool name sanitization to prevent doom loops

## 0.5.6

### Fixed

- Terminal tools (`plan_done`, `plan_enter`) now force-end the turn — prevents the model from keeping runs alive by rewording summaries to dodge the doom-loop detector
- `plan_done` no longer echoes full plan content into model context, which invited endless "refinement" loops

## 0.5.5

### Added

- Changelog page with version history from 0.1.0 to 0.5.4
- Sequential prev/next navigation on all documentation pages (reading loop: Getting Started → ... → Changelog → Getting Started)
- `/usage` command documented in README and interactive commands reference
- Plan mode refine option uses the regular composer (multi-line and image paste supported)

### Fixed

- Improved provider error classification — OpenAI SDK `APIConnectionError` cause chain is now fully traversed for accurate error reporting

## 0.5.4

Fix: ensure non-negative token counts in usage tracking and streaming.

## 0.5.3

Fix: `/usage` now correctly shows sub-agent token breakdown.

## 0.5.2

### Added

- `/usage` command — show cumulative session token/cost usage
- `/exit` command — alias for `/quit`

## 0.5.1

### Changed

- Repositioned cast as a "role-based agent harness" — 13 built-in personas, same tools, different judgment

## 0.5.0

### Added

- **Plan mode** — `/plan` enters a read-only exploration phase; the agent studies the codebase and writes a structured execution plan with a checklist
- Plan tools: `plan_write`, `plan_edit`, `plan_read`, `plan_done`, `plan_discard`, `plan_enter`, `plan_check`
- Per-phase model support — `/plan-model` sets a separate model for planning vs building
- Plan files persist as markdown in `~/.cast/plans/`; survive compaction and session restarts
- Approval dialog: implement now, clear context + implement, approve for later, or refine
- E2E smoke test for plan mode

### Changed

- Comprehensive documentation overhaul — all features now documented in `docs/`
